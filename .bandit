# Bandit configuration for Jok3r Penetration Testing Framework
# 
# Bandit is a security linter for Python that will flag many patterns
# in this codebase as vulnerabilities. However, this is a pentesting
# framework where these patterns are intentional and necessary.

# Skipped tests (security checks that are intentional in this context)
skips:
  # B602: subprocess call with shell=True - Required for tool execution
  - B602
  # B603: subprocess without shell equals true - We intentionally use shell=True
  - B603
  # B607: Starting a process with a partial path - Tools may be in PATH
  - B607
  # B608: Possible SQL injection - This tool tests for SQL injection
  - B608
  # B609: Wildcard injection - May be used in testing
  - B609
  # B201-B210: Flask debug and other web vulns - May be present in test code
  - B201
  - B501: request with verify=False - May be needed for testing

# Exclude certain directories from scanning
exclude_dirs:
  - /tests
  - /doc
  - /pictures
  - /wordlists
  - /webshells
  - /.git

# Set confidence level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
# We'll still catch HIGH confidence issues

# Severity level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
